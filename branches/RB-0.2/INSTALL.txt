INSTALLATION
=========================
To install, first copy all the contents of the dosme folder (including
the .htaccess file) into the directory you wish to serve out of (usually
the root serving directory)

If you don't want to clobber your existing htaccess file, then append
the changes to it. Also, if you decide not to put dosme in your root
directory, you must change the .htaccess file in the root dosme directory
so that it redirects to the appropriate location.

Now, edit the config.php to reflect the URL users need to use to use
your shortener, and set the WARNUSERS flag to what you want. You also
need to set the appropriate database settings in this file. Once done,
place in the directory above the dosme code.

Finally, just run the following in a shell:

mysql db_name < dos_links.sql

Make sure you replace your db info as needed before you run it.

Now everything should be up and running! If you have problems, feel
