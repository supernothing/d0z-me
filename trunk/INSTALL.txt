INSTALLATION
=========================
To install, first copy all the contents of the dosme folder (including
the .htaccess file) into the directory you wish to serve out of.

If you don't want to clobber your existing htaccess file, then append
the changes to it.

Now, edit the config.php to reflect the URL users need to use to use
your shortener, and set the WARNUSERS flag to what you want.

Then, copy the db_config.php file to a directory above and enter
all your information appropriately.

Finally, just run the following in a shell:

mysql db_name < dos_links.sql

Make sure you replace your db info as needed before you run it.

Now everything should be up and running! If you have problems, feel
